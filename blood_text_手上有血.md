Blood on Hands

手上有血

When I was a child, I always met those I couldn't understand. Then I thought sincerely that all the problems would automaticlly get down  when I grew up.

在我还是个孩子的时候，总会遇见许多我理解不了的事情。那时候我总天真的想，等我长成个大人了，问题自然就会迎刃而解。

Partial of this thought is right. For example, "Why can't I eat the whole birthday cake, why I have to share with the family", and the questions like that. I didn't get the answer, till I grow up, I bought one by my salary, I eated the whole one by myself. When I started to feel acid in my hung, I got it. 

这个想法部分是对的，比如说“为什么我不能一个人吃掉整只生日蛋糕，必须要和家人分享”一类的问题，等自己长大之后拿工资买一整只口服下去，等到开始吐酸水，也就悟了。

Rest of the question was wrong, totally wrong. For questions  I didn't get answer as a child, I didn't get the answer as an adult. As the ages grew, the quesions with no answer appeared all the time, they were moving forward endlessly.

其余的大部分都是错的，而且是大错特错。小时候不明白的事情，长大了也找不到答案。而且，随着年龄增长，无解的事情层出不穷，绵延向前根本没有尽头。

if quesion could not be solved, you should ask. But whom? As a child, I thought everyonene is different. When I entered the adult's society, where everyone was wearing clothes, I found everrone had the same look, and everyone was confident. If you were in Beijing-like places, there were masters with anwers crowed in the street. Just after a afternoon team, you could get back home with a truck of aswers.

有问题解决不了，那就应该去请教。可是，请教什么人呢？小时候看人，每一个都不同。一旦进入成人社会，大家穿上了衣服，每一个人看起来都差不多，而且同样自信。如果是在北京这样的地方，满街都是带着答案的大师，只要是一杯下午茶的时光，你就可以带着一皮卡答案回家。

There was a splendid paradox: he who could give answers, he did not talk about these questions. And if he didn't talk about it, you could hardly find him. For an simple example: By Reviewing the blogs on the internet, those who had wrote a lot about UI design, did an ugly design for his own product. Those who wrote a lot about product experiences, did an ugly  product. Those who talked a lot about his industry, he went no long if he started his own businss.

这里有一个非常奇妙的悖论：能给你答案的人，往往不经常谈论这种问题。可是如果他不经常跳出来言说，你又很难发现他的存在。很简单的例子，就是在网上看Blog，凡是那些写了许多关于UI设计方面文章的家伙，自己做出来的东西都一塌糊涂。凡是写了许多关于产品心得文章的家伙，自己造出来的产品都惨不忍睹。更不用说各种大谈特谈行业心得的家伙，一般下水创业之后铁定都是没顶的命。

I got to know the importance of bypassing the talk long long later. Talking  was so easy, but  the product with hands on was so difficult to be deceived. Good was good, bad was bad. If he whose hands were with blood, whose body was with sweat, you would better to listen to his suggestions, even if he couldn't speak.

一直到了很后来，我才终于知道绕过言辞的重要性。言说是一件太容易作伪的事情，但是手下的活却很难藏住马脚，好就是好，不好就是不好。如果一个人手上有血，身上有汗，那么他的建议最好是去听一下，哪怕他是个结巴。

So, after reviewing so many resumes, I never pay any attention on the glories adj. I paide a lot attention on whether he did mayor amerualy. If you were an UI designer, would you do anyPS  after your working? If you were an coder, would you do any practice small programs? He who did these, really liked this. No matter how the quality was, his future was so bright. Because he was not afraid of getting his hands dirty.

所以，看过无数张履历表，我却不会去看上面高高挂着各种形容词，而我却看重这个人有没有在业余时间里做自己的专业玩。如果你是一个美工，会不会在业余时间PS几张设计图？如果你是一个程序员，会不会在业余时间里写几个实用的小程序？会这么做的人，是真的喜欢这件事情，哪怕之前做的活很一般，未来不可限量。因为，他不怕把手弄脏。

If his hands were with blood, that meaned he had known hope and disappointment, he had known what betweened failure and success. He didn't have too many floating imaginations, he would never had to won trust by speaking better. There was always a  cooperation and a  respect when you faced with him, without speaking to each other.

只要手上有血，意味着一个人之前已经背负过希望和失望，知道成败之间需要的究竟是什么。在他那里，就不会有太多不切实际的玄想，更不会用言辞把这些想法包装起来以获取信任。和这样的人相对，哪怕彼此默默无言，也总有一份默契和尊重。

The blood became black when the water went away. In Italian Cicilinic speaking, this was called Mafia.

等这手上的血痕干了，就会慢慢变成黑色，在意大利语西西里的土话里，称之为：MAFIA。
