Hanging in Beijing for Seven Years

Seven years ago, the same day as today, it was 2008 May 12th. I left my hometown Kunming. I began the life in Beijing. Besides an diploma and certification,  I have a middle-class certification of Weahter engineer, which give me the prove that I have the ability to do the forecast. My only ability as an expert is make the flying plans, give the permission of the planes to fly. But in the destination where I was leaving for, they were useless.

七年前的今天，2008年5月12日，我离开家乡昆明，开始了北漂生涯。当时除了毕业证书和学位证，我还有一张气象工程师的中级职称证明，证明我有能力从事气象预报工作。我唯一的专业技术能力是制定航班计划，放行飞机。而在我即将前往的那个地方，它们都根本用不上了。

It was not that kind things any more, I had none permanant jobs any more.

不再是那种玩法，我变成为一个没有单位的人。

I slept in residence of my friends,  moved from one to another. It was in the hot summer. I remembered. It was sunny, windless, all the cars on the street stoped suddenly. I move my head out of the window to find out how did it look in the momerial day. It was very silient at that moment,  but I just was wandering, that I had three questions in front of me clearly.

- What can I do?
- What can I do, right here ,right now?
- How manys days my saving will last for?


在北京的朋友家里借住，从一个朋友家搬到另一个朋友家。炎炎夏日，我记得那天晴好无风，柳丝低垂，旗幡不动，满街的车子停下来，我把头伸出窗子想看看哀悼日究竟是什么样子。那一刻非常安静肃穆，而我却突然走神，有三个问题清晰地浮现在面前：

-我会做什么？

-我能做什么？

-我的存款还能支撑多久？

From that day on, for some years, I saw the three sentences on any thing,  just like the subscript, no matter what I was doing, no matter where I was. The color of the subscript was  lighter at Zhong Guan Cun, Wu Dao kou, and the color of the subscript was heavier at  Guo Mao, Gong Ti, Shi Mao Tian Jie. I told this to my good friend YangYangYang, at a winter night. We got a litter drunk, and stood at the street not steadily. Yang hug my shouder, pointed the Switerness Apartment, said:

> "My bro, I know you can't help thinking, right here in Beijing, which lightening house is yours, which running car is yours. When you think about this, you will feel the life is fucking far far away. But I told you, maybe at the same time next year, you     will have got everything you want. Any way, here is Beijing! "

从那天开始，在随后的几年里，无论我手头在做什么，身在何处，看到的任何东西上面都加上了这三句话的字幕。在中关村、五道口，字幕的颜色要淡一些；在国贸、工体、世贸天阶，字幕的颜色就要刺眼一些。某个冬夜喝酒出来，我把这事跟好朋友羊羊羊说了，我们喝得有些发飘，站在街边晃晃悠悠。老羊搂着我的肩膀，指着对面的瑞士公寓对我说：

> “兄弟，我知道你忍不住要去想，在这北京城里，哪一间亮着灯的房子会是你的，哪一辆开过去的车子会是你的，这些破事儿一想起来就觉得这人生一下子他妈的遥远极了。可是我告诉你啊，兴许明年这个时候，这一切你都有了呢？毕竟，这里是北京啊！”

The next year pasted, the next next year pasted,  and lots of next year had pasted silently, just as the people saying "see you soon" at the cross road,  but never meeting again. But Yang's oppotimistic saying "Any way, here is Beijing" was always in my ears. It was not about the car or the house, which was merely the metopher of personal desires. Life couldn't be without desire, but people couldn't live on desires. It is tough, and we should keep optmistic.

明年过去了，明年的明年也过去了，许多个明年无声无息悄悄流逝，就像在十字街头挥手道别说再见却再也没见的那些人，而老羊那句天真乐观的“毕竟，这里是北京啊”却一直在我耳边回响。这无关车子房子，它们只是一些关于个人欲望的比喻。人生不可以没有欲望，但人也不能仅仅靠着欲望过活。世事艰难，我们必须保持天真乐观。

There were three kinds of birds in the world. One was wild. Flying was its instinct. One was living in the cage for all days. Flying was its desire, but it never knew.  Another one escaped from the cage, and it flied while it knew nothing about flying.

这世上有三种鸟。一种生下来就是野鸟，飞翔是它的本能；一种一辈子都活在笼子里，渴望但是不知道飞翔为何物；还有一种从笼子里出逃，竟然不知深浅地飞了起来。对于野鸟和笼中鸟来说，它们各自接受了一个完整的世界。野鸟从来不考虑风大雨狂，因为那就是它的世界本来的样子。笼中鸟也不会考虑明天的晚饭，因为在它的世界里食槽天然就是满的。最难的是第三种鸟，因为它要穿越两个世界，学习两套规则，努力彻底忘记笼中岁月，学着爱上面前的风雨，习惯不知道明天的晚饭在哪里。
