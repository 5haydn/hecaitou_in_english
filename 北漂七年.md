北漂七年

Seven years ago, the same day as today, it was 2008 May 12th. I left my hometown Kunming. I began the life in Beijing. Besides an diploma and certification,  I have a middle-class certification of Weahter engineer, which give me the prove that I have the ability to do the forecast. My only ability as an expert is make the flying plans, give the permission of the planes to fly. But in the destination where I was leaving for, they were useless.

七年前的今天，2008年5月12日，我离开家乡昆明，开始了北漂生涯。当时除了毕业证书和学位证，我还有一张气象工程师的中级职称证明，证明我有能力从事气象预报工作。我唯一的专业技术能力是制定航班计划，放行飞机。而在我即将前往的那个地方，它们都根本用不上了。

It was not that kind things any more, I had none permanant jobs any more.

不再是那种玩法，我变成为一个没有单位的人。

I slept in residence of my friends,  moved from one to another. It was in the hot summer. I remembered. It was sunny, windless, all the cars on the street stoped suddenly. I move my head out of the window to find out how did it look in the momerial day. It was very silient at that moment,  but I just was wandering, that I had three questions in front of me clearly.

- What can I do?
- What can I do, right here ,right now?
- How manys days my saving will last for?


在北京的朋友家里借住，从一个朋友家搬到另一个朋友家。炎炎夏日，我记得那天晴好无风，柳丝低垂，旗幡不动，满街的车子停下来，我把头伸出窗子想看看哀悼日究竟是什么样子。那一刻非常安静肃穆，而我却突然走神，有三个问题清晰地浮现在面前：

-我会做什么？

-我能做什么？

-我的存款还能支撑多久？

From that day on, for some years, I saw the three sentences on any thing,  just like the subscript, no matter what I was doing, no matter where I was. The color of the subscript was  lighter at Zhong Guan Cun, Wu Dao kou, and the color of the subscript was heavier at  Guo Mao, Gong Ti, Shi Mao Tian Jie. I told this to my good friend YangYangYang, at a winter night. We got a litter drunk, and stood at the street not steadily. Yang hug my shouder, pointed the Switerness Apartment, said:

> "My bro, I know you can't help thinking, right here in Beijing, which lightening house is yours, which running car is yours. When you think about this, you will feel the life is fucking far far away. But I told you, maybe at the same time next year, you     will have got everything you want. Any way, here is Beijing! "

从那天开始，在随后的几年里，无论我手头在做什么，身在何处，看到的任何东西上面都加上了这三句话的字幕。在中关村、五道口，字幕的颜色要淡一些；在国贸、工体、世贸天阶，字幕的颜色就要刺眼一些。某个冬夜喝酒出来，我把这事跟好朋友羊羊羊说了，我们喝得有些发飘，站在街边晃晃悠悠。老羊搂着我的肩膀，指着对面的瑞士公寓对我说：

> “兄弟，我知道你忍不住要去想，在这北京城里，哪一间亮着灯的房子会是你的，哪一辆开过去的车子会是你的，这些破事儿一想起来就觉得这人生一下子他妈的遥远极了。可是我告诉你啊，兴许明年这个时候，这一切你都有了呢？毕竟，这里是北京啊！”

The next year pasted, the next next year pasted,  and lots of next year had pasted silently, just as the people saying "see you soon" at the cross road,  but never meeting again. But Yang's oppotimistic saying "Any way, here is Beijing" was always in my ears. It was not about the car or the house, which was merely the metopher of personal desires. Life couldn't be without desire, but people couldn't live on desires. It is tough, and we should keep optmistic.

明年过去了，明年的明年也过去了，许多个明年无声无息悄悄流逝，就像在十字街头挥手道别说再见却再也没见的那些人，而老羊那句天真乐观的“毕竟，这里是北京啊”却一直在我耳边回响。这无关车子房子，它们只是一些关于个人欲望的比喻。人生不可以没有欲望，但人也不能仅仅靠着欲望过活。世事艰难，我们必须保持天真乐观。

There were three kinds of birds in the world. One was wild. Flying was its instinct. One was living in the cage for all days. Flying was its desire, but it never knew.  The other one escaped from the cage, and it flied while it knew nothing about flying. From the wild and cage ones, they acccpted a complete world. The wild never cared about the storm and rain, because its world is just like that. The cage one never worried about tommorow's dinnder, because the bowl was always full in its world. The third one was hard. Because it needed to cross through two worlds, it had to learn two kinds of rules, tried hard to forget the days in the cage,  leant to fall in love with the storm and rains, and got used to worrry about tommorow's dinner.

这世上有三种鸟。一种生下来就是野鸟，飞翔是它的本能；一种一辈子都活在笼子里，渴望但是不知道飞翔为何物；还有一种从笼子里出逃，竟然不知深浅地飞了起来。对于野鸟和笼中鸟来说，它们各自接受了一个完整的世界。野鸟从来不考虑风大雨狂，因为那就是它的世界本来的样子。笼中鸟也不会考虑明天的晚饭，因为在它的世界里食槽天然就是满的。最难的是第三种鸟，因为它要穿越两个世界，学习两套规则，努力彻底忘记笼中岁月，学着爱上面前的风雨，习惯不知道明天的晚饭在哪里。

It was as saying goodbye to itself, getting teared down with itself, trying hard to wave the wings, and being afraid of stop to look back. But it knew very clearly that, every direction to fly to was at dark night, it couldn't identify the way forward or back at all. The most thrilling thing was not the unknown  but the known, even the emotions were useless. So, being optimistic was the only assurance. The power supporting the fly hard at night was not the new direction but the light, which  in the heard was so small and weak but never down. It was the only one I would never like  to reveal in all kinds of self-illusion.

就像自己和自己道别，自己和自己撕裂，梗着脖子拍打翅膀，生怕自己停下来会忍不住回头去望。而自己心底非常清楚，此刻往哪一个方向飞都是暗夜，根本分不清前路和归途。暗夜飞翔，最可怕的并不是未知，已知才会成为一种负累，连情感都是多余。所以，天真乐观是唯一可靠的依仗。支撑一个人在暗夜里奋力振翅的不是因为有了新方向，而是心头微芒却不灭的那一点火光。在所有的自我欺骗中，我唯一不愿意拆穿的就是这一种。

In the world where there was no cloud image to analyze, no flight to dispatch, no where to have a break or no direction, it needed to keep on flying.

在一个没有云图可以分析、航班可以调度，无处落脚也不知道方向的世界里，要继续飞下去。

Seven years past, I had kept on flying so carmly like a wild bird, and I even seldom realized that I was flying.  The mates' traces could be seen all around. We were flying lonely, but we could have a team in any direction. Someone rushed up, someone rushed down, but no one stoped because of that. We never phoned each other, we had never used a frigrator note or a yellow note to deliver our care or emotion, we kept the comfortable distance and cold, but we were satisfied with the sparks from ourselves when we were in a crash to each other and the silent but smooth cooperation when we were rushing. We met right here right now, even we pasted each other a moment later. We never asked the past and never asked for the future. We streched the second into the most possibility, and we built up the pleasurement at the mesurement in milisecond, which looked like we had no memories at all.

七年过去，我像一只野鸟一样无动于衷地飞翔，甚至很少意识到自己正在飞行的这个事实。环顾四周，都是同类的踪迹。我们孤零零地飞行，却在任何一个方向上都能形成编队。有人急速爬升，有人无端端下坠，却没有人因此而停下。我们之间绝少电话嘘寒问暖，不使用冰箱贴和黄色便签纸传情达意，保持着让人感觉舒适的疏离和冷漠，又能满足于激烈对撞时彼此身上焕发出来的激烈火花，和急速冲刺时彼此无言的默契配合。我们在此时此地相逢，哪怕一刹那之后就要擦身飞过，也不去追问过去，不去求索未来，只是把这一秒钟拉伸到极限，在毫秒级尺度上建立欢乐，活得就像是没有回忆。

I had never forcaseted the weather any more from then on, I had forgotten the accuracy in that days, and I was living in the weather. I had never checked the flighting plan any more. When the flight was later, I  sit somewhere with a power plugin, and  I had another planed schedule . Saying something about the subscription: one day in the warm afternoon, when I went downstairs to have a lunch, the young waiter took out the dishes according to my habit without asking me. I was in a little shock, and at that moment, all the subscriptions falled into the flowting beer glass, and they never showed up.

我再没有预测过天气，过往的准确率我都已经忘记，我就在天气里；我再也没有核查过航班计划，延误时在候机楼找个有插座的角落坐下，我有另外一张计划表。至于说那些字幕，有天下午风和日丽，我穿着拖鞋短裤下楼吃午饭，伙计问都不问就端上来我惯常点的几个菜。我楞了一下，就在那一瞬间，所有的字幕都落进依然在荡漾的啤酒杯里，从此消失不见。
