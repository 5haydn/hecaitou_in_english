七年前的今天，2008年5月12日，我离开家乡昆明，开始了北漂生涯。当时除了毕业证书和学位证，我还有一张气象工程师的中级职称证明，证明我有能力从事气象预报工作。我唯一的专业技术能力是制定航班计划，放行飞机。而在我即将前往的那个地方，它们都根本用不上了。



Hanging in Beijing for Seven Years

Seven years ago, the same day as today, it was 2008 May 12th. I left my hometown Kunming. I began the life in Beijing. Besides an diploma and certification,  I have a middle-class certification of Weahter engineer, which give me the prove that I have the ability to do the forecast. My only ability as an expert is make the flying plans, give the permission of the planes to fly. But in the destination where I was leaving for, they were useless.

It was not that kind things any more, I had none permanant jobs any more.

I slept in residence of my friends,  moved from one to another. It was in the hot summer. I remembered. It was sunny, windless, all the cars on the street stoped suddenly. I move my head out of the window to find out how did it look in the momerial day. It was very silient at that moment,  but I just was wandering, that I had three questions in front of me clearly.

- What can I do?
- What can I do, right here ,right now?
- How manys days my saving will last for?
